		<p> 
        I am a college graduate from Angelo State University. 
		I recieved a degree in Management (BBA), 
		but I'm seeking graduate programs in the hopes of furthering my education. 
		My favorite subjects include technical writing, anthropology, economics, and history. As one might assume, I enjoy critical thought. Furthermore, I have a well rounded concept of management, marketing, data analysis, and economics. I specialize in micro economics. 
        I have participated in several case studies in which SWOT analysis, internal and external matrix, and financial analysis were key points of study. Any opportunity to express my strengths would be appreciated. I am driven and motivated.
